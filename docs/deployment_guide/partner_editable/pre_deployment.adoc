== Predeployment steps

=== Operating System for Deployment

You can use Linux for {partner-product-short-name} Database installation on AWS. The Quick Start deployment uses Linux and supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 8.2.

=== Tibero Memory Configuration
{partner-product-short-name} Quick Start maps each EC2 Instance type to a Tibero SGA size in megabytes (60% of available RAM in the EC2) and SHMMAX kernel (75% of available memory). This Quick Start provides default settings that you can see and revise in the Mappings section of the AWS CloudFormation template.
