image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/Tibero-TSC-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets. Database instances use the NAT gateways to securely download the operating-system packages required to install Tibero.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*

* In the private subnets:
** A Tibero Standby Cluster (TSC), which comprises two EC2 instances in the first two Availability Zones. Each EC2 instance is attached to an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. These volumes house your primary and standby databases.
** An EC2 instance in the third Availability Zone—the Tibero observer instance—to detect failure in the primary database.

* Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda to maintain TSC mode by automatically booting the failed primary database in nonactive mode (standby mode) or the failed observer process.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that stores the installation files that are used when you deploy the Quick Start.
