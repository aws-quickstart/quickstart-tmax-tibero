//This Quick Start deploys a http://www.tmaxsoft.com/products/tibero/[Tibero^] relational database to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. With this architecture, database administrators, enterprise architects, system administrators, and developers can run Tibero in a highly available Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) environment using Tibero Standby Cluster (TSC). If the primary EC2 instance fails, it fails over to a standby instance.

//The Quick Start deployment supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 8.2.
